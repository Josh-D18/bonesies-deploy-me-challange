# What is this application!?

- A mini challenge I created to help students practice deploying a front-end application via Netlify[https://www.netlify.com/].
- This app is currently designed for 1280 screen.

## Getting started:

- In terminal, navigate into the folder you'd like to house this project in.
- git clone this project.
- npm start your freshly cloned project to make sure it's working how it should.
- Make any changes you'd like (you can also do this after it's deployed as well)!
- Create a GitHub repo for this project.
- Create a Netlify account [https://app.netlify.com/teams/musical-bonesie/overview]

## Get Ready to Deploy!

- Log into your Netlify account.
