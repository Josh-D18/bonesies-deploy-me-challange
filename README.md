# What is this application!?

- A mini challenge I created to help students practice deploying a front-end application via Netlify[https://www.netlify.com/].

## Getting started:

- In terminal, navigate into the folder you'd like to house this project in.
- git clone
- npm start your freshly cloned project to make sure it's working how it should.
- Create a Netlify account [https://app.netlify.com/teams/musical-bonesie/overview]

## Get Ready to Deploy!
